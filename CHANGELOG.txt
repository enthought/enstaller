2015-XX-XX   4.8.3:
-------------------

Bug fixes:

  * Fix virtualenv detection to work w/ venv (3.3+ and our backport)
  * Fix etag handling when running both python 2 and 3 (#497, #500)

2015-02-11   4.8.2:
-------------------

Bug fixes:

  * Reject invalid version in repack (#444)
  * Fix handling of the --prefix option and prefix setting in .enstaller4rc (#473)
  * Fix running enpkg as root (#458)
  * Fix enpkg --config-path to expand ~ (#487)

2014-12-18   4.8.1:
-------------------

Bug fixes:

  * Fix race condition when fetching indices (#449).
  * Fix wrong IAuth definition (#446).

Internals:

  * new internal tool enstaller.tools.unpack, used for some low-level build
    tasks at Enthought.

2014-12-09   4.8.0:
-------------------

Main highlights:

  * added support for python 3 (>= 3.3) and pypy (#274)
  * http connections consolidated, CA certificates validated everywhere by
    default.
  * Add -k/--insecure option to ignore CA certification checks.
  * enstaller now provides a proper user-agent when accessing a remote
    server (#319)
  * token-based authentication when using brood store (#266). One can also
    use API token instead of passwords.
  * enpkg now retries downloading eggs when checksum mismatch occurs
    before bailing out (#278), and retry connection failures as well (#350)
  * indices are fetched in parallel (#424)
  * new bootstrap script that works on every platform and is more reliable
    than the old build.sh hack (#320)
  * `.enstaller4rc` is now searched in the following order:
    * sys.prefix
    * user's home directory
    * parent virtualenv (when applicable)

Bug fixes:

  * pypi confirmation is asked before resolving dependencies (#323)
  * fix enpkg crash when atom is installed over gdata (#338)
  * enpkg --info "last modified" output has been restored (#296)

Internals:

  * dependency resolution is now in enstaller.solver. The new Solver class only
    resolve dependencies (install/remove action, no fetch action anymore)
  * http handling has been consolidated in the Session class. Authentication is
    now pluggable through the IAuthManager.
  * test suite does not access network anymore. Http tests handled through
    the response library (#285)
  * add a new YAML-based configuration (not enabled yet).
  * Auth configuration has been consolidated and is now pluggable
    (currently supports storing authentication as username/password or api
    token).
  * enstaller.tools.repack added (replacement of endist `build_egg -r`).
    This feature requires okonomiyaki >= 0.3.3 (available in Enthought'
    repositories and on pypi).

2014-08-29   4.7.0:
-------------------

Main highlights:

  * authentication handling has been streamlined. When credentials are missing
    and/or invalid, enpkg displays an error message instead of crashing (#144).
  * enpkg always uses the same authentication method, whether keyring is
    installed or not.
  * support for python 2.5 has ben dropped
  * add use_pypi = True/False configuration entry to enable/disable pypi repo
    access (True by default)
  * add enpkg-repair script to fix .egg-info directories
  * egginst and enstaller now use logging instead of print statements. Verbose
    output may be obtained through 'enpkg -v', very verbose through
    'enpkg -v -v'.
  * add the -y option to automatically answer yes everytime enpkg prompt the
    user for confirmation
  * ask for confirmation when installing unsupported pypi eggs

Bug fixes:

  * #144: enpkg crashed when credentials were invalid, or when requesting
    packages requiring credentials while not authenticated.
  * #149: handle invalid proxy strings gracefully.
  * Handle Ctrl+C gracefully, and don't print a traceback anymore. Returns an
    exit code of 130, as usually returned by aborted programs on Unix.

Internals:

  * enstaller internal configuration is not a singleton anymore.
  * Store classes are gone, and Repository instances are used instead
  * Enpkg class is now only concerned with execution: dependency resolution is
    done through a separate Solver class. It also allows for iterator-based
    execution for integration with 3rd party packages.
  * urllib* has been replaced by requests
  * configuration is properly parsed instead of being exec'd.
  * remove undocumented and unused 'enpkg --revert file' feature.
  * remove undocumended hook feature

2013-12-16   4.6.3:
-------------------

Main highlights:

  * Add support for cancellation in fetch API
  * Undocumented feature --freeze/--requirement (used internally @ Enthought
    only)
  * Don't print the traceback when crashing anymore, unless ENSTALLER_DEBUG is enabled
  * Egginst now installs eggs in a way that follows easy_install more closely.
    In particular, entry points should now be recognized correctly.

The project setup has been significantly improved however:

  * Code coverage nearly doubled
  * Unused code (e.g. hook feature) has been removed from egginst
  * Added requirements for dev + tox setup + travis-ci + coveralls.io

All earlier versions
--------------------
All earlier versions of Enstaller used a completely different architecture
and design and were quickly deprecated from active usage due to instability
problems.
